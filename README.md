# simpleJWT

[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/RogerCreasy/simpleJWT/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/RogerCreasy/simpleJWT?branch=master)

A package to manage JSON Web Tokens, simply.

This is just a playground for me to learn to manage JWTs. May evolve into more...
More will be added later.
